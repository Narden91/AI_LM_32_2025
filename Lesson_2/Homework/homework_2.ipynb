    "## Short Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your experiments with both exercises, answer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Admissibility and Consistency\n",
    "- **Which heuristics in Exercise 1 were admissible? Why?**\n",
    "  - Manhattan, Euclidean, and Diagonal are all admissible because they never overestimate the true cost\n",
    "  - The inadmissible heuristic (1.5× Diagonal) can overestimate, making it inadmissible\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Which heuristics were consistent (satisfied the triangle inequality)?**\n",
    "  - All admissible heuristics that are also monotonic are consistent\n",
    "  - Diagonal distance is consistent for 8-directional movement\n",
    "  - Manhattan is consistent for 4-directional movement (but underestimates for 8-directional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Speed vs. Optimality Trade-offs\n",
    "- **Where did you observe the clearest trade-off between search speed and solution optimality?**\n",
    "  - The inadmissible heuristic in Exercise 1 expanded far fewer nodes but sometimes found suboptimal paths\n",
    "  - The aggressive heuristic in Exercise 2 was faster but risked missing better routes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When might you prefer a faster, potentially suboptimal solution?**\n",
    "  - Real-time applications (video games, interactive systems)\n",
    "  - When the cost difference between optimal and suboptimal is small\n",
    "  - When computational resources are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Heuristic Design for Flight Routing\n",
    "- **In Exercise 2, when would the Haversine-based time lower bound break admissibility?**\n",
    "  - If we assume a speed faster than the maximum possible aircraft speed\n",
    "  - If we don't account for minimum connection times or airport constraints\n",
    "  - If flights don't follow great-circle routes (e.g., avoiding restricted airspace)\n",
    "  - If we use distance/speed < actual minimum flight time on any route\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What real-world factors could make our admissible heuristic inadmissible?**\n",
    "  - Headwinds/tailwinds affecting actual flight speeds\n",
    "  - Mandatory layover times not captured in edge weights\n",
    "  - Flight routes that must avoid certain airspaces\n",
    "  - Airport congestion and taxi times\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Practical Insights\n",
    "- **For a delivery robot in a warehouse, which heuristic would you recommend and why?**\n",
    "  - Diagonal distance for 8-directional movement: admissible, efficient, and well-matched to the problem\n",
    "  - Balances optimality guarantee with good search efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For a flight booking website with millions of queries per day, what approach would you take?**\n",
    "  - Consider using a slightly inadmissible heuristic for speed if near-optimal is acceptable\n",
    "  - Pre-compute common routes\n",
    "  - Use bidirectional A* for better performance\n",
    "  - Cache results for popular city pairs"
