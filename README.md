# AI_LM_32_2025

AI course materials for the Master's degree LM-32 at
UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale (UNICAS).

Author: Emanuele Nardone

## Course overview

This repository contains lecture notes, notebooks, and homework for a practical
AI course offered within the Master programme LM-32. The course focuses on
foundational search and optimization techniques, population-based metaheuristics,
and basic neural network learning algorithms. Materials emphasize hands-on
implementations and practical problem solving.

## Learning objectives

- Understand and implement fundamental uninformed and informed search
  algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*).
- Learn graph algorithms for shortest paths and spanning trees (Dijkstra,
  Kruskal, MSTs) and their practical applications.
- Explore population-based optimization methods (Genetic Algorithms, Particle
  Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization) and when to apply them.
- Implement and train simple neural networks (LVQ, Backpropagation) for
  classification and regression tasks.
- Develop experimental rigor: evaluate algorithms, compare performance, and
  document findings.

## Course structure

- Mode: Practical lessons + homework + Jupyter notebooks
- Materials: Lecture slides, code notebooks, sample datasets, homework
- Evaluation: Homework assignments and practical project (detailed in the
  course page or handed-out syllabus)

## ðŸ§­ Overview of the 5 Practical Lessons

Lesson | Topic(s) | Focus
--- | --- | ---
1 | BFS & DFS | Fundamental uninformed search
2 | A* & Informed Search | Heuristics and optimality
3 | Graph Optimization (Dijkstra, Kruskal, MST) | Shortest path and spanning trees
4 | Evolutionary Algorithms (GA, PSO, Ant Colony) | Population-based metaheuristics
5 | Neural Networks (LVQ, Backpropagation) | Learning algorithms and applications

### Brief lesson notes

- Lesson 1 â€” BFS & DFS: review problem representations (graphs, states),
  implement breadth-first and depth-first search, discuss complexity,
  completeness, and use-cases.
- Lesson 2 â€” A* & Informed Search: introduce heuristics, admissibility and
  consistency, implement A*, design simple heuristics for pathfinding and
  puzzle problems, analyze optimality.
- Lesson 3 â€” Graph Optimization: implement Dijkstra's shortest path, Kruskal's
  algorithm for minimum spanning tree, discuss performance and applications
  (network design, routing).
- Lesson 4 â€” Evolutionary Algorithms: present Genetic Algorithms, Particle
  Swarm Optimization, and Ant Colony Optimization; implement simple variants
  and apply them to benchmark optimization problems.
- Lesson 5 â€” Neural Networks: cover Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and
  feedforward networks trained with backpropagation; implement training loops,
  loss functions, and evaluate on small datasets.
