    "**How Recursive BFS Works:**\n",
    "While BFS is typically implemented iteratively with a queue, a recursive version can be created by passing the queue as a parameter to recursive calls. Each recursive call processes the current level's nodes and adds the next level to the queue for the next call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Uses recursion with an explicit queue parameter\n",
    "- Maintains the level-order traversal property\n",
    "- Less common than iterative BFS, but demonstrates the concept\n",
    "- Same traversal order as iterative BFS\n",

    "**Breadth-First Search (BFS):**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- **Guarantees shortest path**: In unweighted graphs, BFS finds the shortest path from start to any node\n",
    "- **Level-order traversal**: Visits nodes level by level, providing a clear hierarchical view\n",
    "- **Complete**: Will find a solution if one exists (in finite graphs)\n",
    "- **Optimal for minimum steps**: Perfect for problems requiring the fewest number of edges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- **Memory intensive**: Stores all nodes at the current level, can use exponential space in worst case\n",
    "- **Slow for deep graphs**: May explore many irrelevant nodes before finding the target\n",
    "- **Not suitable for infinite graphs**: Can get stuck in infinite loops without proper cycle detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depth-First Search (DFS):**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- **Memory efficient**: Only stores the path from root to current node, much less memory than BFS\n",
    "- **Fast for deep solutions**: Can quickly find solutions in deep, narrow graphs\n",
    "- **Natural for backtracking**: Perfect for problems requiring exploration of all possibilities\n",
    "- **Works well for infinite graphs**: With proper cycle detection, can handle infinite state spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- **No shortest path guarantee**: May find a long, winding path instead of the shortest one\n",
    "- **Can get stuck in deep branches**: May explore very deep before finding a solution\n",
    "- **Not complete**: In infinite graphs without cycle detection, may loop forever\n",
    "- **Stack overflow risk**: Recursive implementation can cause stack overflow for very deep graphs\n",
