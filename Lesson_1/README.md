# Lesson 1: Graph Algorithms - BFS and DFS

## Overview

This lesson introduces fundamental graph traversal algorithms through interactive Jupyter notebooks. Students explore Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) with hands-on implementations, visualizations, and real-world applications.

## Lesson Structure

### Section 1: Binary Tree Traversal

- Create and visualize a 4-level balanced binary tree
- Implement iterative BFS and DFS traversals
- Understand level-order vs depth-first exploration

### Section 2: General Graph Algorithms

- Work with random graphs (10 nodes)
- Compare BFS and DFS on complex graph structures
- Visualize traversal orders with step-by-step annotations

### Section 3: Recursive Implementations

- Explore recursive versions of BFS and DFS
- Understand stack-based vs queue-based recursion
- Compare iterative vs recursive approaches

### Section 4: Algorithm Comparison

- Detailed pros/cons analysis of BFS vs DFS
- Time/space complexity comparison
- Use case recommendations with comprehensive table

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Graph Fundamentals**: Create, visualize, and manipulate graphs using NetworkX
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Master both iterative and recursive BFS/DFS approaches
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Compare time/space complexity and optimal use cases
- **Real-World Application**: Apply algorithms to social networks and navigation problems
- **Problem Solving**: Complete guided exercises with visualization feedback

## Technical Requirements

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib numpy
```

## Files Included

- `Homework/homework_1.ipynb` - Practice exercises

## Expected Outcomes

Students will gain practical experience with graph algorithms and understand when to choose BFS vs DFS for different problem types, backed by visual demonstrations and real-world examples.
